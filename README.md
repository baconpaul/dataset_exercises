# dataset_exercises

Paul, Gordon and Rob had a long email conversation about whether we could have a CS middle
school course which is closer to what a data-conversant person would experience when using
programming environments. This stood in contrast to the idea of "build an app," which seems
like a common and useful but limited exercise. So Paul offered to bang together an example.


* generate.py generates the datasets in the "data" directory. You can edit it to create
whatever sets you want. By default it creates a smaller and larger set.

* There are two iPython notebooks which show how you would play around with the data in
python if you used raw lists or pandas. The pandas one is clearly the pedagogical
thing I'm moving towards, but involves introducing a lot of ideas.
